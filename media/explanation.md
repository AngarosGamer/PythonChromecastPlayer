# Why this folder and file

This folder will hold the music media files while using the app, using the chosen extension and a pseudo-random name.
If the folder doesn't exist, music will fail to be downloaded.

While the app does delete music files after use (when app is closed, or a new song is chosen), it can sometimes fail to delete everything.
In this case, media files can be deleted manually.
